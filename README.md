# light-encrypt
Light low overhead pre-shared key AES encryption for embedded systems based on [tiny-AES-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c). Optimized for 256 bytes LoRa packet size.

Instead of sending the whole Initialization Vector we can store a static decimated 14 byte version on each nodes and only send two randomly generated bytes to complete the IV. This solution recudes overhead.

# Compile

```c
gcc test.c tiny-AES-c/aes.c encrypt.c -I./tiny-AES-c
```

# Run

```bash
./a.out
```
